              Day 6 : Visit Doodhsagar Waterfall
            </h5>
            <p>
              While you must be thinking that North Goa is home to the best
              beaches, then you are forgetting the Dudhsagar Falls, which should
              be one of the highlights of your trip. Start your day early, so
              that you can spend enough time here to appreciate the beauty of
              this place. Of course, Goa gets even prettier than when it rains,
              and the waterfall, far from the tourist hotspots, literally comes
              alive during the monsoon. After this, you can visit the Aguada
              Fort, which lies within one-and-half hours by road from the falls.

              Day 7 : Explore Local Market, Nearby Beaches and Check out from
              Hotel
            </h5>
            <p>
              It is one of the best markets in Goa to know the city’s real
              flavors. If you are visiting Goa for the very first time and you
              have a long vacation plan then you must head to Mapusa Market in
              the free time. Here, you will find unique textiles, antiques, and
              souvenirs that you can purchase to take back home. If you love
              traditional handicrafts then you would love to explore the market
              at its best. There you will find Goan pottery, pickles, spices and
              more. Do visit this place in the day time as it closes by sunset.
              It’s a long market and hence, we recommend you to take your time
              while exploring the market.
